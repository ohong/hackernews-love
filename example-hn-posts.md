# "Well, This Is an Exceptionally Cute Idea"
## Products Dunked On by Hacker News That Became Wildly Successful

The HN comment section has a rich history of confidently dismissing products that went on to become some of the most successful companies and technologies in the world. Here are the best examples — complete with the most deliciously wrong comments.

---

## 1. Dropbox (2007)
**Post:** "My YC app: Dropbox – Throw away your USB drive" — Drew Houston, April 4, 2007
**Thread:** [news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863)

**The dismissal:**
> *"I have a few qualms with this app: 1. For a Linux user, you can already build such a system yourself quite trivially by getting an FTP account, mounting it locally with curlftpfs, and then using SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem. From Windows or Mac, this FTP account could be accessed through built-in software."* — **BrandonM**

This became the single most famous bad take in HN history — the "I could build this myself with existing unix tools" archetype. Another commenter added:

> *"It doesn't seem very viral or income generating."*

**What actually happened:** Dropbox IPO'd in 2018 at a $12B valuation. Drew Houston later [thanked BrandonM by name](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16659180) when Dropbox went public: *"Even you BrandonM — my favorite HN comment thread of all time :)"*. BrandonM himself later [reflected](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6625306): *"We see who from that conversation is now a billionaire... so, it seems I was wrong."*

## 2. Bitcoin (2009)
**Post:** "Bitcoin: peer-to-peer network based anonymous digital currency" — chaostheory, May 8, 2009
**Thread:** [news.ycombinator.com/item?id=599852](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=599852)

**The dismissal:**
> *"Well this is an exceptionally cute idea, but there is absolutely no way that anyone is going to have any faith in this currency."* — **jdoliner**

The entire thread had just 3 comments and 5 upvotes. Three. Comments. For what would become a $2 trillion asset class.

**What actually happened:** A single bitcoin went from fractions of a cent in 2009 to over $100,000 by 2024. The total crypto market cap exceeded $3 trillion.

## 3. Airbnb (~2010–2011)
**Post:** Airbnb rebranding from "Airbed & Breakfast" and pivoting to broader housing rentals
**Thread:** (multiple HN threads during early launch period)

**The dismissal:**
> *"I've said this before. Renting a room/bed out of your home like a hotel most likely violates multiple tax and business laws in just about every US city... let alone the severe liability someone faces should a guest in your home slip in the shower and break their collar bone. I've worked at a resort hotel. Cities have specific bed taxes. Hotels have to be inspected. They have liability insurance. Vacation rental owners pay taxes. Some cities don't even allow short-term vacation rentals. We've already seen the ride-sharing website ruled illegal in some cities. I predict the same thing will happen here... If I was a VC, I wouldn't touch this site."* — **callmeed**

A textbook example of the "it's illegal therefore it will fail" fallacy — which also managed to preemptively dismiss Uber at the same time.

**What actually happened:** Airbnb IPO'd in 2020 at a $100B+ valuation and is now worth over $80 billion. It is one of YC's most successful companies ever.

## 4. Figma (2015)
**Post:** "Launch of Figma, a collaborative interface design tool" — Dylan Field, December 6, 2015
**Thread:** [news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10685407](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10685407)

**The dismissals:**

> *"MEH"* — **williamle8300**

(An entire comment. Just "MEH." For a company that would be valued at $20 billion.)

> *"'And even better, it lives in the cloud.' Lost me here. I just want a solid desktop app that isn't a web wrapper or lives in the browser. I can't stand web apps to be honest. It's almost there, but it always feels like a cheap copy of what should be a proper desktop application."* — **EC1**

> *"The main differentiator and focus of the post is 'we're making this run in the browser'. But nowhere does it explain *why* that's better for designers. You don't need it to power collaboration features. This echoes Asana and a lot of the 'HTML native' product efforts. Which have mostly failed as a technical approach and resulted in a return to platform native apps."* — **abalone**

> *"$18MM to spend only to see if you got it wrong is a rather interesting approach."* — **salimmadjd**

**What actually happened:** Adobe tried to acquire Figma for $20 billion in 2022 (blocked by regulators). Figma IPO'd in 2025 at a $60B+ market cap. The browser-based approach that commenters dismissed turned out to be the product's greatest competitive advantage.

## 5. Cursor — First Post (March 2023)
**Post:** "Cursor: A code editor built for programming with AI" — mntruell, March 24, 2023
**Thread:** [news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35285047](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35285047)

The post got just 14 upvotes. Fourteen.

**The dismissals:**

> *"There's nothing on the official website or GitHub that indicates what this software is, other than a cropped screenshot that looks like vscode with a prompt pop up over it. Edit: I still can't figure out if this is just some sarcastic joke software or something."* — **yakaccount4**

> *"AI is still in an info-phase Bitcoin was in before 2017... Expected to see an avalanche of fake/fraud/phony products based on it as we've seen about blockchain. Also expected to see some bs in a spirit of (but unlike) NFTs."* — **wruza**

> *"So looking through the dependencies, it's CodeMirror with a VsCode theme on top of it, that includes Copilot. Why wouldn't I just use an existing editor with Copilot support?"* — **Deukhoofd**

**What actually happened:** By 2025, 1 billion lines of code were being written on Cursor every day. It was valued at $10 billion and became the dominant AI code editor.

## 6. Cursor — Second Post (October 2023)
**Post:** "Cursor – The AI-First Code Editor" — robenkleene, October 15, 2023
**Thread:** [news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37888477](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37888477)

**The dismissals:**

> *"I was mildly interested in this, until I saw the 'testimonials'... Click through to their twitter bio: 'CEO @HyperWriteAI, @OthersideAI - I make AIs do the impossible.' Okay, right. Sure... seeing all these blue check AI hype men do their 'thoughtleading' is an instant red flag for me. It's the exact same crypto bro bullshit all over again."* — **madeofpalk**

> *"The NFT grifters have simply moved on to AI. I wonder what shiny object will infatuate them next?"* — **wildrhythms**

> *"It's like crypto bros but for software development."* — **delusional**

> *"Good for extracting money from dumb VCs, bad for users."* — **the_gipsy**

> *"Alternatively, if you just want to integrate Copilot into Neovim and get on with your day..."* — **hiAndrewQuinn**

A Cursor developer patiently replied:

> *"(One of the Cursor devs here) Appreciate the feedback! Can see how this can come across as hype-y. We're a small team of all software engineers and I think we have a thing or two to learn about branding."* — **mntruell**

**What actually happened:** $10 billion valuation. One billion lines of code per day. The most widely adopted AI coding tool in existence.

## 7. Instacart (2012)
**Post:** "Instacart (YC S12) wants to be Amazon with 1 hour delivery"
**Thread:** HN discussion of YC S12 Demo Day

**The dismissal:**

> *"I can't help but wonder whether the company will find a business model with sustainable economics. A lot of really smart people have tried and failed to accomplish this sort of thing before. For example, Amazon invested $60 million in Kozmo.com back in the late 90's, and they couldn't make it work. Kozmo.com ended up raising a quarter billion dollars before shutting down."* — **cs702**

The "this was tried before and failed" argument. The classic graveyard-pointing fallacy.

**What actually happened:** Instacart IPO'd in 2023 and is worth over $12 billion. COVID-19 turned grocery delivery from a novelty into a necessity, and Instacart was perfectly positioned.

## 8. Windsurf / Codeium (2022)
**Post:** "Show HN: Codeium — a free, fast AI codegen extension" — Varun Mohan
**Thread:** HN Show HN post

**The dismissal:**

> *"I'll go ahead and ask the obvious question. What's the difference with Copilot? In my exactly 3 minutes test, it did worse, even if only slightly. Right now it is free, but that won't last, right? Do I have to expect any shady data collection practices?"* — **micoloth**

Three minutes. The commenter gave it exactly three minutes before pronouncing judgment.

**What actually happened:** Windsurf was acquired in a deal worth $2.4 billion, with its CEO and key employees joining Google. The remaining company was acquired by Cognition Labs (makers of Devin).

## 9. React (2013)
**Post:** Facebook open-sources React at JSConf US, May 2013
**Thread:** Multiple HN threads in 2013

**The dismissals:**

React's launch was met with widespread mockery for mixing HTML into JavaScript via JSX. The general HN sentiment:

> *"I understand that JSX isn't necessary, but we spent so long taking logic out of the HTML that now we want to go ahead and instead put HTML in the logic? The biggest problem with this is that it doesn't do well in separating the HTML from the business logic."*

> *"What they told us was that we'd taken a 'huge step backwards' in terms of the maintainability of our code, simply because we were embedding our markup, our HTML, inside our JavaScript."* — (as recounted by the React team themselves at React Conf 2015)

The developer community overwhelmingly felt React violated fundamental software engineering principles. "Separation of concerns" was the rallying cry against it.

**What actually happened:** React became the most popular UI library in the world, used by over 20 million developers. It fundamentally changed how web applications are built and spawned an entire ecosystem (React Native, Next.js, etc.). In 2025, Meta donated React to the Linux Foundation.

## Patterns in the Dismissals

Looking across these examples, a few recurring archetypes emerge:

1. **"I can build this with existing tools"** (Dropbox, Cursor) — The classic engineer's fallacy of confusing "technically possible" with "good product."

2. **"This is illegal / will be shut down"** (Airbnb) — Confusing regulatory risk with impossibility.

3. **"This was tried before and failed"** (Instacart) — Ignoring that timing, technology, and execution matter enormously.

4. **"This is just crypto-bro hype"** (Cursor, Windsurf) — Guilt by association with the previous hype cycle.

5. **"MEH / Joke software"** (Figma, Cursor) — The drive-by dismissal that ages worst of all.

6. **"Nobody will want this"** (Bitcoin) — Pure failure of imagination.

As one HN commenter [wisely observed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19025560) in retrospect: *"For the broader community, I think the takeaway is intentionally being almost unreasonably supportive of people building things."*
