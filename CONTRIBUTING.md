Know a company that HN dismissed? We'd love to add it.

## Quickest way

Click **"Add Suggestions"** on the site. It opens a pre-filled GitHub issue with four fields:

1. **Company** — name of the company/project
2. **HN Thread URL** — link to the original Hacker News discussion
3. **Dismissive Quote(s)** — verbatim comments from the thread, with usernames
4. **What Actually Happened** — the outcome (acquisition, IPO, mass adoption, etc.)

That's it. We'll handle the rest.

## Via PR

If you'd rather submit a PR directly, add a new entry to `data/posts.ts` following the existing format and open a PR.

## Guidelines

- Quotes must be **real, verbatim HN comments** — no paraphrasing.
- The company must have a **clear outcome** that proves the skeptics wrong.
- One good quote is better than four mediocre ones.
